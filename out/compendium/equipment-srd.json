      "name": "The Whispering Reeds",
      "description": "<p>This hefty tome was compiled centuries ago by an anonymous author who sought to collect all parables, myths, stories, and encounters with the Outer Goddess Nhimbaloth. According to the introduction, the author's original intent was to create a work that foes of the Empty Death could use to fight against her influence, but as one reads through the book, it becomes apparent that the opposite effect has been achieved—by compiling these stories, the author inadvertently generated a work that made it easier for Nhimbaloth to influence the world. Those who venerate the Empty Death seek copies of this book to use as a guide and religious text, while those who don't know better and peruse the book as though it were merely an anthology of stories find themselves unwittingly falling prey to Nhimbaloth's cult or agents of the entity herself. Those who study from The Whispering Reeds for too long are often cursed to rise as ghosts after death— though their existence never lasts for long, as they are inevitably consumed by Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<p>If a character understands the dangers of this book, however, moderated use can stall or even prevent such a fate from befalling them. If a character takes special care, they can even potentially use The Whispering Reeds for its original purpose—as a weapon against the cult of Nhimbaloth. Using the text too often or leveraging some of its more powerful effects, however, causes the user to feel an ominous chill. In these cases, the user is exposed to the tome's curse, Empty Death.</p>\n<p>The anonymous compiler wanted to produce an enormous print run of The Whispering Reeds, but after the initial run they realized the danger and scuttled those plans, instead attempting to destroy those copies already created. This crusade caught the attention of Nhimbaloth's cult, who swiftly assassinated the compiler. Fewer than two dozen copies of this rare tome are believed to still exist. The book's sinister nature causes all attempts to transcribe it to fail, resulting in bodies of gibberish, nonsense text.</p>\n<p>The Whispering Reeds provides several abilities, but you can't activate any of them while you are @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied} unless you are a follower of Nhimbaloth.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 10 minutes (Investigate);</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> You gain a +2 item bonus to skill checks to Recall Knowledge about Nhimbaloth, her faith, or creatures associated with her (such as incorporeal undead, vampiric mists, wisps, and other incorporeal creatures associated with death).

Every 7 days that pass after you become a ghost, you must succeed at a DC 2 flat check— failure indicates that you are consumed by Nhimbaloth.

The first, a delicate brush and a jar of extremely fine dust, is used to reveal fingerprints left behind by most humanoid creatures. The dust sticks to the natural oils left behind on smooth surfaces. When you use the kit to determine whether or not creatures left behind a fingerprint at a crime scene, the GM rolls a secret Thievery check against the Thievery DC of every creature capable of leaving prints that has interacted with the scene. On a success, you locate a clear print from that creature and carefully transfer it to a special sheet of sticky paper. (Note that fingerprints can last for days, and prints collected in this manner often include those of victims, witnesses, and unrelated passersby.) At the GM's discretion, the print-leaving creature might get a bonus to its Thievery DC for taking special precautions. In other cases, finding a print might be impossible (such as if the creature was wearing gloves or if the location has been significantly compromised).</p>\n<p>The second part of the kit is a small sheaf of paper and a pad soaked in ink. By forcing a humanoid creature with fingerprints to roll a finger across the pad and then press it to the paper, you can obtain an image of the unique whorls in that creature's fingerprints. These can then be compared to any prints found at a crime scene. Successfully determining whether or not two prints match requires a DC 15 Perception check-the GM should roll this check secretly as well, since a failed check may result in false information.</p>"

Once she finished its physical construction, the sorcerer Belcorra Haruvex used this spot as a source of power to infuse the walls, floors, and ceilings of each of Gauntlight's levels with eldritch power. The lens at the apex of the lighthouse would have, in time, been able to focus this lingering eldritch energy into a powerful beam, but Belcorra's plans were cut short before she could replace the mundane lenses with dangerous magical ones.</p>\n<p>As an artifact, Gauntlight can't be damaged by normal means. Its walls are impenetrable and impervious to any attempt to breach them by anybody except for followers of Nhimbaloth. They block effects that allow temporary passage, such as passwall, and also create a barrier against dimensional travel. The walls attempt to counteract teleportation effects and planar travel into or out of areas within Gauntlight and efforts to summon creatures into the area (using a +37 counteract modifier); this effect does not stop a summoned creature from departing when the summoning ends.</p>\n<p>In Gauntlight's current state of diminished functionality, it can be activated only in the two ways below.

These lenses are described in “Eyes of Empty Death,” the third adventure in the Abomination Vaults Adventure Path.</p>\n<p>To activate Gauntlight, a creature must be in the deepest portion of the artifact (this chamber is in the Temple level and is presented in “Eyes of Empty Death”).

It appears as a 5-foot-tall, 2-footwide mirror of dark glass. As long as it's unmounted in a frame, the Void Mirror functions only as a mirror, save that it always reflects the sky as if it were night, regardless of the time of day. When the Void Mirror is mounted in a frame, it instead serves as a window into space, displaying a star field in its glass rather than a reflection. This frame can be of any quality, but stouter frames help to prevent the frame's destruction and thus help to keep the Void Mirror functional.</p>\n<p>The view presented by the Void Mirror is any view of the night sky possible from its current physical location, regardless of time of day.

Building such a frame is beyond the skill of low-level characters, as it requires an artisan with legendary proficiency in Crafting.</p>\n<p>The Void Mirror can be utilized in other ways, but before a character can activate these effects the occult methods to access these ritual-like effects must be Researched separately. Since the specific methods for these activations vary slightly from person to person, these methods can't be taught; each person who seeks to activate the Void Mirror in one of the following ways must complete their own research to unlock the artifact's secrets.

The target creature must be a level equal to or less than the user's level +4.

The creature's initial attitude toward the user is helpful, but this attitude can shift quickly if the creature realizes its goals and personality differs dramatically from the user's, or if the user makes a request of the creature that's against its nature. As long both the creature and the user are within 30 feet of the Void Mirror, the user can return the creature to its original location by Dismissing this activation. The creature can attempt a Will save against the user's Occultism DC to resist being returned; if it succeeds, it's temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the creature is indifferent upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> As critical success, but the creature is hostile upon arrival.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, but magical feedback from the failed activation causes the user to become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 3}.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 7 days (Interact);</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> Accumulate 12 RP by making DC 40 Occultism (legendary) checks when Researching (1 year per attempt);</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per century;</p>\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The third activation ritual is known as \"Become the Void\" and requires the user to continue performing the rite for 7 consecutive days (as if they were performing a multi-day ritual). If the user fails to perform this rite for one of these 7 consecutive days, they immediately suffer the critical failure effect below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The user's body, mind, and soul are infused with alien energies drawn from the Dark Tapestry, which transforms the user into an aberration of a level no higher than their current level +4. This new form could be an existing aberration or a unique one of the GM's creation. The user retains their memories and spellcasting ability (including any rituals they know) but becomes chaotic evil and loses all other abilities they possessed in their previous form.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the aberration the user transforms into can be of a level no higher than half the user's current level.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The user's attempt to change is a painful mistake that deals [[/r {10d6+40}[bludgeoning]]]{10d6+40 bludgeoning damage} as their body twists, bends and breaks. Ultimately, they are not transformed.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The user is slain, but their body shifts and transforms into a brand new creature as the bodiless alien intelligence Tchekuth incubates within the user's flesh, mind and soul. This transformation takes another 7 days to complete but can be halted indefinitely if the Void Mirror is placed in a specially constructed frame aimed at the body's location (regardless of any solid object between the mirror and the body). Slowing or stopping this transformation via other means requires complex rituals or divine intervention, subject to the GM's whim. After 7 days, the body completes its transformation and Tchekuth rises once more as a physical threat.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> A creature that completes the apotheosis of Becoming the Void can destroy the Void Mirror by smashing it, though doing so also destroys the creature performing this action in a violent burst of occult energy.</p>"

      "description": "<p>This enormous, multifaceted prism normally rests on a pedestal, eerily refracting many-colored lights even when no light source is present. In reality, the prism refracts the four magical essences into the visible spectrum. A creature adjacent to the prism can adjust its facets with an Interact action to change between two polarities. Two essences flow from two input streams into the prism, where the prism combines them into a single output stream; alternatively, a single essence flows from one input stream into the prism and is split into two output streams. A creature that enters and stays within an input essence stream for 1 minute is slowly encased in solid magic, at which point it is paralyzed until anyone reverses the prism's flow or finishes activating the prism. A creature stepping into an output essence stream is gently pushed back and out of the stream.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">D</span> Interact; <strong>Effect</strong> You alter and rearrange the facets of the essence prism, adjusting the essences to select for a single quality, which might be associated with mental essence, like a personality trait; material essence, like a physical quality; vital essence, like a belief or instinct; or spiritual essence, like an alignment component such as good or lawful. You must succeed at a secret DC 30 skill check with a skill associated with a magical tradition that uses the essence you chose (for instance, Arcana or Occultism for mental essence, as arcane and occult magic both use mental essence). On a failure, you accidentally set the prism for some other quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact); <strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has only one input stream, and a creature is encased in magic in the input stream; <strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the creature in the input stream has its essences refracted through the prism, creating two cocoons of magic in the output streams that each contain a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creature is gone, and the two new creatures break free of their cocoons. Each creature is part of the original, separated from the rest based on the last quality set by the prism's first activation. For instance, if you set the prism to \"good\", one creature would have all the original creature's good aspects and the other would be the original creature's evil side. Unless you selected a physical quality, both new creatures look just like the original. The new creatures are usually 2 levels lower than the original, but if the original creature was strongly biased with respect to the quality you chose (for instance, if splitting out the good and evil side of a redeemer), the stronger creature is 1 level lower and the weaker creature is 3 or more levels lower. If calibrated correctly, this activation can also reverse the effect of the third activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 minute (Interact); <strong>Requirements</strong> The prism has two input streams, and a creature is encased in magic in each of the input streams; <strong>Effect</strong> Over the course of the next hour, the essences of both creatures in the input streams are refracted through the prism, creating a cocoon of magic in the output stream that contains a new creature. At the end of the process, the original creatures are gone, and the new creature breaks free of its cocoon. The new creature is an amalgam of the originals, with a new personality blended from both, and is usually 1 or 2 levels higher than the higher level of the original creatures unless the lower-level creature was much weaker. This activation also reverses the effect of the second activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Forcing the <em>essence prism</em> to combine two incompatible demigods destroys the prism, though it might also result in a new divinity.</p>"

The <em>philosopher's extractor</em> is designed to create the ultimate alchemical concoctions. The extractor functions as an exceptional set of alchemist's tools, granting a +4 item bonus to Crafting checks related to alchemy. When using the extractor to Craft an alchemical item or with infused reagents as part of your daily preparations, you can create impeccable alchemical items. An impeccable alchemical item always uses the maximum numerical value possible for any rolls it requires, such as dealing maximum damage with alchemist's fire or restoring the maximum number of Hit Points with an elixir of life. If the impeccable item has a duration, it lasts twice as long as normal. Finally, an impeccable alchemical item never has a drawback.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">T</span> Interact; <strong>Frequency</strong> once per minute; <strong>Effect</strong> You use the extractor to produce an alchemical item of your level or lower whose formula you know. The extractor can create 56 levels' worth of items per day in this way. For example, the extractor could create two true elixirs of life (19th level) and two moderate elixirs of life (9th level), or eight comprehension elixirs (7th level), and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Activate</strong> 1 hour (Interact); <strong>Effect</strong> You take a sizable portion of a creature (at least two-thirds of its original mass) and filter it through the mechanisms of the extractor. After the end of the process, the philosopher's extractor creates a transmogrifying mutagen that imparts the essence of the creature to the drinker. The extractor can make several transmogrifying mutagens simultaneously using the same activation if enough mass is provided at once, up to a maximum of 10 concurrent mutagens. Drinking a transmogrifying mutagen imparts you with one of the creature's unique abilities for 1 hour. This could grant one of several abilities such as a dragon's Breath Weapon, darkvision, flight, frightful presence, or immunity to sleep. The ability functions as it did for the original creature, except it uses your class DC or your spell DC (whichever is higher) instead of the creature's DC. The mutagen grants only abilities based on a creature's physiology and never grants magic-related abilities such as innate spells or spellcasting ability. The GM ultimately decides what ability a transmogrifying mutagen grants.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal for mutagens and effects, you can drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens and gain benefits from each. When you drink transmogrifying mutagens made from different creatures, you receive abilities from each creature. When you drink multiple transmogrifying mutagens made from the same type of creature, such as multiple mutagens made from trolls, you gain an additional ability for each transmogrifying mutagen you drink, and the duration of the abilities from that creature type increases by 1 hour for each additional concoction you drink.</p>\n<p>However, these additional benefits come with a risk; if you drink a transmogrifying mutagen while at least one other is active, after drinking it, you must succeed at a flat check with a DC equal to the total number of active transmogrifying mutagens you've consumed. On a failure, you fully transform into a member of the species of the latest transmogrifying mutagen you drank, and you almost always go berserk from your change. The transformation may leave some amount of your personality and memories intact, at the GM's discretion.</p>\n<p><strong>Destruction</strong> Simultaneously feeding the philosopher's extractor sizable portions of an aeon, angel, archon, azata, daemon, demon, devil, protean, and psychopomp, each of at least 14th level, along with a philosopher's stone causes the device to jam, overheat, and explode.
